            <h2>Ibiza</h2>
             <p>
                I would watch movies or even see videos of Ibiza, and there is no denying that its beauty has a magic pull to all that
                visit and settle down. When people explain why they visit the island in the first place, their response is 
                normally along the lines of wanting to escape the monotony back home and do something out of the ordinary.<br>
                Every year partiers and beach lovers flock to the island to dance all day and night listening to the best 
                DJs in the world as well as having a great time at some of the most beautiful beaches in Europe.
                I love the ocean so much, so the beaches on the island of Ibiza are simply stunning.The parties in Ibiza 
                are well known. The clubs entice people to enter their clubs and escape for a few hours with amazing music, 
                sets and scenery. There are so many nights to choose from and so many clubs too. A range of boredom-busting 
                options are available from waterparks and boat trips, to mini-clubs and jeep safaris.
